</ul>
<p><strong>You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this section, your takedown request may not be valid or may be delayed in processing.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that for the specific purpose of reviewing and processing your claim of an alleged copyright infringement and to safeguard our legitimate business interests and the legitimate interests of our users, when submitting a takedown request, we are required to process your personal data and provide the uploader of the material at issue with the following personal data: your name, your contact information, as well as the contents of your takedown request. If you are an authorized representative submitting a report, we provide the name of the organization or client that owns the right in question. We rely on your consent to transmit your personal data to the takedown request or counter-notification claimant and without it, we are unable to process your takedown request or counter-notification as prescribed under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act &quot;<strong>DMCA</strong>&quot;. Where the party against whom you are making your takedown request resides outside the European Economic Area &quot;<strong>EEA</strong>&quot;, you also acknowledge and consent that your personal data may need to be transferred outside the EEA and we consider the transfer to be potentially necessary for the establishment, exercise and defense of legal claims. We undertake to transmit your personal data exclusively for the purpose of assessing the merits of your takedown request and will notify the recipient of the data of this limited purpose and the confidential and sensitive nature of your personal data.<br />
However, we are unable to control the use of your personal data by the recipient, and we do not accept that we are in the position of being a joint controller of personal data sent to the recipient and we do not accept any associated liability for any breaches.</p>
<p>You consent to your personal data being transmitted to the uploader of the material at issue in line with the Privacy Notice if you do not have an account and in line with the Privacy Policy if you have an account.</p>
<p><strong>Copyright Counter-Notification Process</strong></p>
<p>When an uploader's video submission has been removed, the Website will notify the uploader of this removal. Pursuant to the Website's policies and in accordance with the DMCA, the uploader has five 5 days to submit a counter-notification to the Website, explaining why the original takedown request was sent in error. The counter-notification may be sent to WebGroup's email address from which the user originally received the forwarded takedown request.</p>
<p>For the Website to consider a counter-notification, it must include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a physical or electronic signature of the uploader; AND</li>
<li>identification of the material that has been removed by providing one or more URLs where the material was previously available; AND</li>
<li>a statement under penalty of perjury that the uploader has a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; AND</li>
<li>the uploader\'s name, address, and telephone number; AND</li>
<li>a statement that the uploader consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the user is located, or if the uploader's address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which the Website may be found; AND</li>
<li>a statement that the uploader will accept service of process from the takedown request claimant or an agent of such person.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Counter-notifications that do not satisfy all of these elements are ineffective and may not be considered by the Website.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that for the specific purpose of reviewing and processing your counter-notification related to the relevant takedown request and to safeguard our legitimate business interests and the legitimate interests of our users, we will process your personal data and will provide the party who originally made the takedown request with your completed counter-notification, which will include the following personal data: your name, and contact information, as well as the content of your counter-notification. We rely on your consent to transmit your personal data to the addresses of your takedown request or counter-notifications and without it, we are unable to process your takedown request as prescribed under the DMCA. Where the takedown request claimant resides outside the EEA, you also acknowledge and consent that your personal data may need to be transferred outside the EEA and we consider the transfer to be potentially necessary for the establishment, exercise and defense of legal claims. We undertake to transmit any personal data included in your counter notification exclusively for the purpose of processing your counter-notification and will notify the recipient that any personal data included in your counter-notification is of confidential and sensitive nature. However, we are unable to control the use of your personal data by the recipient, and do not accept that we are in the position of being a joint controller of personal data sent to the recipient and we do not accept any associated liability for any breaches.</p>
<p>You consent to your personal data being transmitted to the takedown request claimant in line with the Privacy Notice if you do not have an account and in line with the Privacy Policy if you have an account.</p>
<p>That person may elect to file a lawsuit against you for copyright infringement. If we do not receive notice that a lawsuit has been filed within ten 10 business days after we provide notice of your counter-notification, we will restore access to the removed materials.<br />
Until that time, your uploaded material will remain inaccessible. We will provide a copy of the original takedown request if asked.</p>
<p>For non-copyright related complaints, such as to report child sexual abuse material, non-consensual sexual acts, privacy violations, abuse, harassment, or other inappropriate or illegal content, please use the form at <a href="https://info.xvideos.com/takedown-amateur">https://info.xvideos.com/takedown-amateur</a> .

<p>If you elect to send WebGroup a Notice of Dispute pursuant to the provisions at Section 10 of these Terms of Service, the notice must be in writing, sent by registered mail and addressed to WebGroup Czech Republic, a.s., Krakovska 1366/25, 110 00 Prague, Czech Republic, Attn:<br />
Dispute Resolution, Subject: Notice of Dispute. Failure to follow this procedure could delay or prevent our review of your Notice.</p>
<p><strong>10. Dispute Resolution, Agreement to Arbitrate, Class Action Waiver, Venue and Forum</strong></p>
<p>In this Section 10, you and WebGroup may be referred to individually as &quot;a party&quot; or collectively as &quot;the parties.&quot;</p>
<p>The parties shall endeavor to resolve <em>any and all</em> claims relating to, arising out of, or in connection with the Terms of Service or your use of the Website by engaging in amicable consultations for no less than thirty 30 calendar days. Before bringing a formal legal case, you must send a written notice of dispute &quot;<strong>Notice of Dispute&quot;</strong> via registered mail to &quot;WebGroup Czech Republic, a.s., Krakovska 1366/25, 110 00 Prague, Czech Republic, Attn: Dispute Resolution- Subject: Notice of Dispute&quot; to give WebGroup the opportunity to resolve the dispute with you informally, as also indicated in Section 9 of these terms of Service.</p>
<p>The Notice of Dispute must contain sufficient information to identify you and the basis of your claim. Amicable consultations will commence upon WebGroup's receipt of a Notice of Dispute.</p>
<p>You and WebGroup agree to negotiate the dispute in good faith for no less than 30 days after a valid Notice of Dispute is provided. If the dispute cannot be resolved by amicable consultations within 30 days after receipt of a Notice of Dispute, you agree that ANY and all existing and/or future controversy and/or claim between you and WebGroup, arising out of or related to this Terms of Service or your use of the Website shall be resolved as follows:</p>
<p><strong>i. No Class Actions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neither you nor WebGroup may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any claim or dispute. Claims or disputes may not be arbitrated or resolved on a class or representative basis.</strong></p>
<p><strong>ii. You and Webgroup Agree to Arbitrate</strong></p>
<p>You <strong>and WebGroup agree to the fullest extent permitted by law to resolve any claims arising out of, relating to, or in connection with the Terms, your relationship with us, or WebGroup's Services, including but not limited to your use of the Website and information provided via the Website, through final and binding arbitration.</strong></p>
<p>An arbitration proceeding is before neutral arbitrators instead of a judge and jury, so by voluntarily accepting these Terms, you and WebGroup agree to give up the right to a trial before a judge and jury.</p>
<p>This agreement applies to all claims except those identified in Section 10 iv. This agreement applies after you stop using or choose to delete your xvideos.com account.</p>
<p><strong>iii. The Arbitration Process</strong></p>
<p>The Arbitration Court attached to the Czech Chamber of Commerce and the Agricultural Chamber of the Czech Republic &quot;<strong>Arbitration Court</strong>&quot; will conduct any arbitration between you and WebGroup, except for disputes in which the Czech state courts have exclusive jurisdiction under Czech law. The parties agree that the Rules of the Arbitration Court are applicable and will govern. You may read the Rules of the Arbitration Court here at <a href="https://en.soud.cz/rules">https://en.soud.cz/rules</a>. This webpage address is potentially subject to change as it is not under WebGroup's control. If any Terms in these Terms of Service conflict with any Rules of the Arbitration Court, the parties agree to follow these Terms.</p>
<p>Disputes shall be resolved by a panel of three arbitrators in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Arbitration Court in effect at the time the notice of dispute was filed or received by WebGroup. The resulting award shall be final and binding on the parties. The seat of the arbitration shall be Prague, Czech Republic; the proceedings shall take place in Prague, Czech Republic; and the language of arbitration shall be English.</p>
<p>The parties agree that the Arbitration Court will have jurisdiction to decide whether a dispute is subject to arbitration under these Terms of Service.</p>
<p><strong>The parties further agree not to pursue injunctive relief i.e., an order that the other party do or not to do something, apart from paying damages in arbitration. Such relief must be sought in court instead. If a party has a dispute for which they seek to obtain both injunctive and other forms of relief, the party must go to court to seek the injunctive relief and must arbitrate to seek the other forms of relief.</strong></p>
<p><strong>iv. Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</strong></p>
<p>You and WebGroup further agree that the Czech District Courts in Prague, Czech Republic, will have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve disputes:</p>
<p>a. relating to your or WebGroup's intellectual property for example, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, or patents; OR</p>
<p>b. where the sole form of relief sought is injunctive relief, including where a party seeks other forms of relief but is bound, as per Section 10 ii, to seek those other forms of relief through arbitration; OR</p>
<p>c. any other judicial proceedings which by law is not subject to arbitration.</p>
<p>In the event your local law prohibits arbitration, you may submit a motion for the extrajudicial handling of your dispute to the designated authority for extrajudicial handling of the consumer disputes, which is the Czech Trade Inspection Authority<br />
<a href="https://www.coi.cz/">www.coi.cz</a> <a href="https://www.coi.cz/">www.coi.cz</a>.<br />
Disputes arising from contracts on service provision concluded online between a consumer with residency in the European Union and a trader established in the European Union can also be resolved using the online dispute resolution platform at<br />
<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr">https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr</a> . Alternatively, and to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable law, you agree that the Czech general courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes in which at least one of the parties to the dispute is a consumer, unless mandatory statutory consumer protection regulations in your country provide as a further alternative that a dispute or controversy arising out of, relating to, or in connection with these Terms of Service be handled by the court of the jurisdiction where you reside or are domiciled. If you are acting as an individual consumer and if mandatory statutory consumer protection regulations in your country of residence or domicile contain provisions that are more beneficial for you, such provisions shall apply irrespective of the choice of Czech law or of Czech courts.</p>
<p>Section 10 of these Terms of Service will survive the termination of your relationship with WebGroup.</p>
<p><strong>11. Governing Law</strong></p>
<p>You agree that the Terms of Service, your use of the Website, and any claims relating to, arising out of, or in connection with the Terms of Service or your use of the Website, shall be governed by the laws of the Czech Republic, except for the laws of the Czech Republic that govern conflict- or choice-of-law. The substantive law of the Czech Republic shall control, to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
<p><strong>12. Separation of Terms</strong></p>
<p>Each of the paragraphs of these Terms of Service operates separately. If any part of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of any such provision shall not affect the validity of any of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which still apply and are binding.<br />
Any unenforceable term will be substituted with a term that comes as close to the unlawful or unenforceable term as possible.</p>
<p><strong>13. General</strong></p>
<p>These Terms of Service, the privacy policy, the rules as written on the upload form, and any other legal notices published on the Website, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and WebGroup. No waiver of any term of these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such Term or any other Term, and WebGroup's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of any such right or provision.</p>
<p>We may amend, and reserve the right to amend, these Terms at any time and for any reason by posting updated Terms on our Website. We will notify you of major changes made to these Terms of Service, such as those relating to the characteristics of the service provided. You are advised to periodically review the most up-to-date version of our Terms of Service, so that you are aware of any changes.
